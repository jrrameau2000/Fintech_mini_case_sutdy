### A Quick Snapshot of Square

### What is the background of your company? What do they do? Who are their competitors?

- Square, Inc. is an American financial services, merchant services aggregator, and mobile payment company based in San Francisco, California.
- The company markets software and hardware payments products and has expanded into small business services. The company was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey and launched its first app and service in 2010.

### How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?

- Square is considered a fintech company because it uses technology in several ways to complete financial transactions.
- Square's point of sale hardware and software allows merchants to receive payment quick and easy. Square also owns CashApp, which is a peer to peer cash transfer service. CashApp allows its users to send money to anyone, anywhere with the click of a button. The transection completes in seconds.
- Square's Payments API is a payment solution that allows a company to accept credit and debit card payments from their own website. They can connect their websites with an ecommerce API application. This allows customers to make purchases on that company's website without ever leaving the actual website.
- Square also allows merchants to accept mobile credit card payments via a plastic dongle that can be inserted into the port of a phone. Square passes the payment transaction information to the Acquiring Processor via an internet connection. Square pays a small fixed fee per transaction to the Acquiring Process.

### Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?

- Square is exemplary due to their simple and easy-to-use platform, complementary Point-of-Sale hardware and its massive user database due to the widespread use of CashApp. Square’s weaknesses are that it’s not ideal for large companies due to its high fees and its platform is elementary compared to a competitor like Stripe.
- Strengths:
  - The Company its very well positioned in the large market for payments.
  - Trough Square Capital They offer revenue based financing for its Merchant
- Weaknesses:
  - Price, Square transactions can be quite expensive, the fees range between 2.75% to 3.5% plus 15 cents Surcharge per Transactions, Square card readers have gain a reputation for not being reliable

### What is the prognosis for this company? Where do they expect to be in the future?

- Square started off as a payment tool for small businesses but has since begun targeting larger businesses, which provides a much larger market opportunity.There are risks, as I mentioned earlier. But there is also much to admire about Square. From a company with ambitions to help small businesses accept credit card payments, Square has grown to a company that offers a wide range of fintech services and now serves individuals through its Cash App.

- The company boasts a strong track record of growth, has an innovative leader who is willing to invest in new products, and a balance sheet that is flushed with cash. All of which puts it in a strong position to ride on the tailwinds of the expanding payments ecosystem.
